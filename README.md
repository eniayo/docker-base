# Docker Base Image Project

## Overview

Docker is a powerful platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. It simplifies the process of packaging your code and dependencies into a deployable unit known as a container.

## Project Description

This project aims to create a custom Docker base image with specific configurations and dependencies. The Dockerfile provided in this project serves as a starting point for building your own customized Docker image.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system
- Basic understanding of Docker and Dockerfiles

### Usage

1. **Creating a Dockerfile**

   Start by creating a Dockerfile. This file contains instructions for building your Docker image. Here is an example of a Dockerfile:

   ```Dockerfile
   FROM python:3.8

   LABEL maintainer="Eniayo Adediran"

   COPY ./app /app
   WORKDIR /app

   # Define default command to run on container start
   CMD ["python", "app.py"]
   ```

2. **Setting Up Your Application**

   Create a directory named `app` in the same directory as your Dockerfile. Inside the `app` directory, include your application code and any additional files or configurations needed.

   Example `requirements.txt`:

   ```
   Flask==2.1.0
   werkzeug==2.0.0
   ```

3. **Building the Docker Image**

   Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing your Dockerfile. Use the following command to build the Docker image:

   ```
   docker build -t custom_base_image .
   ```

4. **Tagging and Pushing the Image**

   After successfully building the image, you can tag it with a repository name and push it to a container registry (like Docker Hub, AWS ECR, etc.). For example, using Docker Hub:

   ```
   docker tag custom_base_image your-dockerhub-username/custom_base_image:latest
   docker push your-dockerhub-username/custom_base_image:latest
   ```
